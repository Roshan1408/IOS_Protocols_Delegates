# 📱 iOS Protocols and Delegates - App with Data Passing

## 📝 Project Description
This repository demonstrates the concept of **Protocols and Delegates** in **Swift** by creating a simple **BMI Calculator App** that passes user data between two view controllers.

The app consists of two screens:
1. The **First Screen** displays labels for **Name**, **Age**, and **City**.
2. The **Second Screen** allows the user to input their **Name**, **Age**, and **City** into text fields and pass this data back to the first screen using **Protocols and Delegates**.

This project is part of my learning journey to better understand **Protocols and Delegates** in iOS development.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The app starts with the **First Screen** displaying placeholder text for Name, Age, and City.
2. The user clicks the **Go To Form** button to navigate to the **Second Screen**.
3. On the **Second Screen**, the user inputs their details and clicks the **Save** button.
4. The entered data is passed back to the **First Screen** using **Protocols and Delegates**, and the labels update accordingly.

## 📖 What I Learned

In this project, I explored the concepts of **Protocols** and **Delegates** in Swift. These are fundamental concepts in iOS development, helping in decoupling the communication between objects. I implemented various protocols to manage the flow of data and communicate between different parts of the application.

---

### Key Takeaways:
- **Protocols** are blueprints for methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular piece of functionality.
- **Delegates** provide a way to send information between objects without tightly coupling them together.
- Understanding how to leverage delegates to handle actions in UI components and other objects.
